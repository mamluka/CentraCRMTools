  We know you had to recently stop all <strong>Centra</strong> services for your business. At a certain level we assume
  responsibility for this taking place. We take pride in not only finding services and products for our partners that
  have the utmost importance to their business, but that are designed around increasing revenue, by also diminishing
  overhead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  If for any reason a cancellation was due to lack of service, we want to know about it. We also want to extend an offer
  to have a conversation with a managing partner, who has the ultimate authority to modify our offerings to best suit
  your needs. Money is not going to be an issue for us and how we want to invest in your business.<br/>
</p>
<p>

  We believe that working with small and medium size businesses nationally and globally is an opportunity to assist and
  invest in some of the smartest and brightest.
</p>
<p>

  Please call 855-<strong>CENTRA</strong>-1 or 855-236-8721 and we will find way to benefit your business even if it is
  at our expense.
